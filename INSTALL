# Prerequisites

## LEMON
* https://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon
* Get lemon. Build it by reading its INSTALL documents.
* The version (as of 2019-03-16) tested with is 1.3.1.
* In my case, I did (not system-wide install.)
    * mkdir build  # make build directory for cmake to work
    * cd build  # get inside it
    * cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/usr/lemon ..
        * Install prefix is specified as above command.
    * make  # compile LEMON
    * make install  # install LEMON.
* check coloquinte/src/CMakeFiles.txt, make sure
  `include_directories($ENV{HOME}/usr/lemon/include)` points to where
  you configured/installed lemon.


# Compiling

Build just like other cmake projects.

* mkdir build
* cd build
* cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/usr/etesian ..
* make # or make -j for multi-threaded build
